# 10deploys-theme

This is the Jekyll theme of the [10deploys podcast's website](https://10deploys.com).


## Installation

To use this theme in your Jekyll's website, add this line to your Jekyll site's `Gemfile`:

```ruby
gem "10deploys-theme"
```

Copy the [`_config.yml`](_config.yml) to your Jekyll's site root directory. And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install 10deploys-theme


## Usage

To experiment with this code, add some sample content and run `bundle exec jekyll serve` â€“ this directory is setup just
like a Jekyll site. Then open your browser at `http://localhost:4000`.

Alternatively, you can use the Jekyll Docker container to experiment with this code. It requires
[Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/) installed:

    $ docker-compose run --service-ports site jekyll serve

Then open your browser at `http://localhost`.


## Layout texts

Copy the files available at the `_data` directory into your Jekyll's website `_data` directory and change the layout
texts as needed.


## Content collections

The default configuration exposes two collections: episodes and pages.

The theme has conventions both episodes and pages image assets names. See
[`_episodes/000-example.md`](_episodes/000-example.md) and [`_pages/example.md`](_pages/example.md) for full reference
on how to create these kinds of pages.
